							<p>In 2018, an eruption of deadly gunshots and violence meant that Mary (center) and her family had 
								to immediately flee their home in South Sudan. They spent the next 3 months fearing for their 
								lives; surviving, while searching for safety in the hot and vast bushes of Lainya district where 
								she was born. She was 9 years old at the time.</p>
	
							<p><i>“We had to leave everything behind,” Mary’s father recalls. “Our home, our farm, our livelihood,everything…”</i> 
								he added.</p>
	
							<p>They later joined a group of other families and made their way to BidiBidi refugee settlement in Uganda, which 
								was the start of a new life as refugees. In 2019, Mary enrolled in a nearby school. <i>“I advised my daughter to 
									repeat grade 3 to catch up with the lost time,”</i> said Mary’s father, a former NGO worker and agriculturalist who 
								used to train farmers on income generation.
								The transition was not easy. <i>“I miss my old friends,”</i> Mary said.
								<i>“I am now in a new environment, and in a new education system, but at least I have made other friends,”</i> she adds.</p>
	
							<h3>Uncertainty</h3>
	
							<p>Barely 2 years on, as Mary was regaining rhythm, the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and schools in BidiBidi closed. It has 
								been over year since she last went to class. In this new reality, Mary and her peers now spend their mornings and 
								evenings playing various learning games under the guidance of parents and community caregivers.</p>
	
							<p>Some of the games are found in the “PlayMatters at Home” learning packets. These packets contain fun learning games that 
								the whole family can play and are helping to mitigate learning loss and overcome stress.
								They were developed as part of the response to the COVID-19 emergency to support caregivers with fun and creative ideas 
								to keep children learning while they are at home as well as reduce stress for families while schools are closed.</p>

										<p class="photo-caption">Mary playing a “tossing rock” game with her peers</p>
									</div>
								</figcaption>
							</figure>
	
							<p>The PlayMatters at Home packets use pictures to show play and learning activities that children can 
								do by themselves and others for caregivers to do with their children. Our response also included an 
								educator’s guide for them to support families in their engagement with the learning through play 
								activities and check on their wellbeing. It also included radio show with learning through play 
								educational content meant to supplement the packets.</p>
	
							<p>In Uganda, the packets were translated into 10 languages reaching refugee and host communities: 
								Madi, Dinka, Rutooro, Kinyabwisha, Acholi, Aringa, Kiswahili, Lugbara, Kakwa, and Juba Arabic. 
								The same packets were distributed in Ethiopia and Tanzania, reaching over 100,000 children in the 
								three countries.</p>

							<h3>The blindfold obstacle game</h3>
	
							<p>One of the games contained in the PlayMatters at Home packets is the “blindfold obstacle game.” 
								“Here, children, under the supervision of caregivers, blindfold each other and attempt to jump 
								obstacles while counting the number of successful jumps,” Mary explained.</p>
	
							<p>This activity makes young learners actively engaged, while at the same time building on basic numeracy 
								skills. It is also a fun activity for children and their caregivers to engage in!</p>
								
							<p>The efforts continue to promote learning through play among vulnerable refugee & host community children, 
								while building their creative, cognitive, physical, social, and emotional skills.</p>
								
							<p>PlayMatters in Uganda, Ethiopia and Tanzania is now piloting content for educators, caregivers and the 
								community to foster playful learning experiences among refugee and host community children while nurturing 
								a generation of lifelong learners in and out of school.</p>
